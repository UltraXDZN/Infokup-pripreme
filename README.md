# Ex Infokup-pripreme
This repo used to be for my preparations for Croatian competitive programming chaimpionship - Infokup.

My current work is preparation for the University I'm a Computer science major and self-progress/upgrade so I can become a better programmer. Some of my solutions aren't the best, but eventually, I'll be able to reach the level I want.

This repository includes solutions to competitive programming challenges/problems that can be found on following competitions or websites for competitive programming:
